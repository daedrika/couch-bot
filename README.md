# discord-voice-cmd
## Motivation
We want to be able to execute voice commands that replicate the functionality for controlling bots present in chats. This would require a Node.JS bot to be listening in a given channel for voice input, convert the speech to text, and then send the relevant command into the Discord server chat.
